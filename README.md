# webhook-deleter

A simple Vue-based web application that simplifies the process of deleting Discord webhooks.

## Purpose

- You can prevent unknown @everyone webhook spams
- Most scams on discord get your information by sending some form of malicious media to the victim, grabbing the information from the webpage, and finally sending the victim's data via a webhook. You can obtain that webhook URL by going on your Developer Tools (record the Network requests), copy the webhook URL and you can delete it from here.
